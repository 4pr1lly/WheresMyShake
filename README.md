"the shake machine is down". Those dreaded words we cannot bare to hear on a hot summers day or get a hankering to satisfy the sweet tooth. How do we try and avoid these dissapointments from our most sought out fast food chains?

What if we had the ability to check the status of an Ice cream machine or shake machine in real time before making the trip out?

With the ability to users real time updates and information based on location,time and date,and status of a working machines others have the ability to see this real time information at their fingertips.


Who cares about this feature? people who are looking for quick desserts. specifically fast food/mcdonalds ice creams and shakes (who are infamously known to always have a machine that isn't working)
What is it that they want? real time updates and location of icecream and shake machines that are working
Why do they want it? to buy advertised product .cravings. price point.
