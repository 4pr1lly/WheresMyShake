"the shake machine is down". Those dreaded words we cannot bare to hear on a hot summers day. How do we avoid these dissapointments when we have a hankering for a shake or ice cream from one of our most sought out and easily accesible fast food chains?

What if we had the ability to check the status of an Ice cream machine or shake machine in real time before making the trip out to satisfy our sweet tooth?

With the ability to see users real time updates and information based on location, others have the ability to see this real time information, enter the location in google maps and head to that fast food location.
